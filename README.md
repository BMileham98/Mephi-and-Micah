# Mephi and Micah's Visual Novel Journey

*Title subject to change

## Overview

This is a multiple route visual novel following a troubled half-angel called Micah and the devil Mephi who ironically may be trying to drag him up the right path. 

The player stars as 'The Conscience', a spirit guiding Micah in his journey. Your job is to keep him safe, sane and on the path of redemption. Whether you succeed depends on his and your own impulse control.

## Features

The project currently has classes for each character implemented to compile their unique stats. 
A debugging overlay has been added to ensure these are tracked correctly. 

A romantic orientation variable is present to alter some events. With the presence of love and platonic relationship variables, this will allow players to dictate WHO they do or don't romance. This also means players can guide Micah through a romance-free journey if they wish.

## Characters

### The Party

Micah - Our deadbeat hero, a half-angel half-human lad who abandoned his familial duties in the name of holy diligence. He is part way to corruption and his redemption lies in the player's hands. Or they can push him further down the messy path of dark impulses. 

Mephi - A necromancing demon who was compelled into finding Micah and dragging him back to his hometown, he is all about getting into others' business while protecting his own. While he is doing good in fetching Micah, he may be committing evil acts in-between.

Clover - A succubus who Micah and Mephi pick up after a failed attempt at thievery. She is a slippery but possibly lonely girl who is not completely happy about their company given the circumstances. Rarely seen without her hellhound 'Kitty'. 

### The Sidelines

Nox - A cat-woman knight the party meets early on, she is a servant of the Frost Kingdom and very much singleminded. However, she does have a strange mischievous side buried under the stiff soldier aura.

Lux - A wandering dragon sorcerer who makes it snow everywhere he goes and is laidback to the point of being irresponsible. He is charismatic but deathly allergic to commitment and maturity. 

Cal - A half-elf priest who is as charming as he is dense, yet possesses a heart more golden than his finances. He is loyal, reckless and oblivious to danger with an accidental tendency to destroy things. 

Luminia - A cheery mysterious priestess who seems to find herself wherever the party goes, usually accompanied by a very strange fanbase / fellow preachers. She's hyper, magnetic and maybe a bit danger-prone.

## Future Features

The visual novel will feature many different endings, regardless of whether the player pursues or avoids romance. This includes a variety of potential bad endings that the player may happily march Micah towards. 
However, Micah's fate naturally determines the fate of your own avatar. 

Micah may be played not just with typical romantic attraction in mind but additionally in accordance to the split attraction model. An important part of developing these relationships is the freedom to do so with complete comfort, hence it will be possible to play Micah as being on the asexual spectrum. Most routes as a result will be tailored to work with and without the presence of lust and physical intimacy. 

(Note - one side romance in particular is not compatible with this philosophy. Why that is, will be seen through story-telling.)

This project was inspired by Dungeons and Dragons so a planned milestone will be to implement a basic battle system. This will be used sparingly as to not drag the narrative on too much.
